These tables serve as a valuable source of data for applications such as web mining, question-answering systems, and knowledge base development. However, not all HTML tables contain actual relational data. Many of them are used primarily for layout and navigation purposes. On the other hand, genuine tables may have different layouts, formatting, and content. One of the challenges in extracting data from web tables is to identify the main functional and layout types and properties of the tables that are commonly found on the internet. Currently, we have a wide range of taxonomies that classify table types and their properties. These taxonomies can be used to categorize tables and select the appropriate method for processing tabular data based on their specific type. Although the existing taxonomies provide a variety of table types, they often use confusing terminology. This paper aims to provide an overview of these taxonomies by aligning their terminology and comparing them in a qualitative manner. ",

The results of Crestan’s research, which became a basis of further research, presented in the paper [4]. During the analysis of these tables, a broad classification and set of problems in extracting tables of certain types were established. This study divides the entire set of tables into relational knowledge tables and layout tables, which are equivalent to genuine and non-genuine accordingly in [1]. Layout tables are further divided into navigational and formatting. However, these table types are not relevant in our study. Below we consider different types of tables according to the Crestan’s taxonomy [4] and give examples to illustrate table reliability to a certain type. ",

In turn, Lehmberg et al. using the WebDataCommons framework [8] extracted and classified tables from the July 2015 version of the Common Crawl based on [7]. As a result, relational tables (Fig. 3, a) that contain a certain number of entities were extracted. In turn, these entities can be described by attributes, which are represented by rows or columns. Another version of tables in which a certain set of attributes describes one entity only (Fig. 3, b) is named entity tables. There are also matrix tables (Fig. 3, c). ",
