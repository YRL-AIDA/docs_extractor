        "text": "Recently, there has been a significant increase in the use of noncombustible nicotine–containing products, including electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes). Of increasing popularity are e-cigarettes that can deliver high doses of nicotine over short periods of time. These devices have led to a rise in nicotine addiction in adolescent users who were nonsmokers. Use of noncombustible nicotine products by pregnant mothers is also increasing and can expose the developing fetus to nicotine, a known teratogen. In addition, young children are frequently exposed to secondhand and thirdhand nicotine aerosols generated by e-cigarettes, with little understanding of the effects these exposures can have on health. With the advent of these new nicotine-delivery systems, many concerns have arisen regarding the short- and long-term health effects of nicotine on childhood health during all stages of development. Although health studies on nicotine exposure alone are limited, educating policy makers and health care providers on the potential health effects of noncombustible nicotine is needed because public acceptance of these products has become so widespread. Most studies evaluating the effects of nicotine on health have been undertaken in the context of smoke exposure. Nevertheless, in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies strongly indicate that nicotine exposure alone can adversely affect the nervous, respiratory, immune, and cardiovascular systems, particularly when exposure occurs during critical developmental periods. In this review, we have included both preclinical and clinical studies to identify age-related health effects of nicotine exposure alone, examining the mechanisms underlying these effects. ",

Preclinical studies in animals support a relationship between nicotine exposure in utero and abnormal respiratory responses in mice.71 Mouse pups exposed to in utero nicotine can develop abnormal respiratory responses to hypoxia and depressed arousal to intermittent hypoxia. Cohen et al50 found that pups lacking functional -2- containing nAChRs had similar respiratory responses as the nicotineexposed pups. Slotkin et $\\mathsf { a l } ^ { 7 2 }$ also found that catecholamine responses were impaired in rats exposed to in utero nicotine. Another study in pregnant baboons given nicotine infusions revealed that offspring developed altered serotonergic and nAChR binding in areas of the medulla that regulate cardiorespiratory control.73 Although no studies were found linking SIDS and infants exposed to noncombustible tobacco products, Nordenstam et al74 reported that infants of mothers who used Swedish snuff or smoked during pregnancy had higher low frequency and high frequency ratios at 1 to 2 months of age compared with controls, indicative of lower vagal activity. Taken together, the preclinical animal studies and observations in children exposed to prenatal smoke indicate a possible association between in utero nicotine exposure and increased risk of SIDS. ",

Behavioral and cognitive outcome studies in children with in utero smoke exposure revealed impaired executive function,80 altered intelligence and auditory functioning,81 and behavioral problems.82 A meta-analysis found an association between prenatal smoke exposure and attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder.83 In a Finnish national birth cohort study, an association was found between in utero smoke exposure and higher rates of behavioral and emotional disorders.84 The combination of preclinical and human studies in children exposed to prenatal smoke indicate that in utero nicotine exposure alone likely contributes to adverse behavioral and cognitive outcomes.

The authors in a study in mice used nicotine e-cigarette aerosols and found that exposed mice had impaired bacterial clearance of Streptococcus pneumonia and increased viral titers of influenza A virus compared with controls.121 Another study in mice revealed that nicotine-activated -7 nAChRs ",
