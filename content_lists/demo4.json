Till now, a great variety of Transformers has been proposed to adapt to the graph-structured data. However, a comprehensive literature review and systematical evaluation of these Transformer variants for graphs are still unavailable. It’s imperative to sort out the existing Transformer models for graphs and systematically investigate their effectiveness on various graph tasks. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of various Graph Transformer models from the architectural design perspective. We first disassemble the existing models and conclude three typical ways to incorporate the graph information into the vanilla Transformer: 1) GNNs as Auxiliary Modules, 2) Improved Positional Embedding from Graphs, and 3) Improved Attention Matrix from Graphs. Furthermore, we implement the representative components in three groups and conduct a comprehensive comparison on various kinds of famous graph data benchmarks to investigate the real performance gain of each component. Our experiments confirm the benefits of current graph-specific modules on Transformer and reveal their advantages on different kinds of graph tasks. ",

Worse still, as pointed out by [Kreuzer et al., 2021], GNNs suffer from the over-smoothing problem due to repeated local aggregation, and the over-squashing problem due to the exponential computation cost with the increase of model depth. Several studies [Zhao and Akoglu, 2019; Rong et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2018b] try to address such problems. Nevertheless, none of them seems to be able to eliminate these problems from the Message Passing paradigm. ",

In the original multi-head self-attention blocks, different attention heads implicitly attend to information from different representation subspaces of different nodes. While in this case, using the graph-masking mechanism to enforce the heads explicitly attend to different subspaces with graph priors further improves the model representative capability for graph data. For example, [Yao et al., 2020] computes the attention based on the extended Levi graph. Since Levi graph is a heterogeneous graph that contains different types of edges. They first group all edge types into a single one to get a homogeneous subgraph referred to as connected subgraph. The connected subgraph is actually an undirected graph that contains the complete connected information in the original graph. Then they split the input graph into multiple subgraphs according to the edge types. Besides learning the directly connected relations, they introduce a fully-connected subgraph to learn the implicit relationships between indirectly connected nodes. Multiple adjacent matrices are assigned to different attention heads to learn a better representation for AMR task. [Min et al., 2022] adopts a similar practice, which carefully designs four types of interaction graphs for modeling neighbourhood relations in CTR prediction task: induced subgraph, similarity graph, cross-neighbourhood graph, and complete graph. And they use the masking mechanism to encode these graph priors to improve neighbourhood representation. ",

On the basis of standard Transformer, methods in the three groups, auxiliary GNN modules (GA), positional embeddings (PE), and improved attention (AT) are compared. Since most methods are composed of more than one graph-specific module and are trained with various tricks, it is difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of each module in a fair and independent way. In our experiments, we extract the representative modules of existing models and evaluate their performance individually. For GA methods, we compare the three architectures described in Section 3.1. In both alternately and parallel settings, the GNNs and Transformer layers are combined before the FFN layers. PE methods include degree embedding [Ying et al., 2021], Laplacian Eigenvectors [Dwivedi and Bresson, 2020] and SVD vectors [Hussain et al., 2021]. AT methods contain spatial bias (SPB) [Ying et al., 2021], proximity-enhanced multi-head attention (PMA) [Zhao et al., 2021], attention masked with 1-hop adjacent matrix (Mask-1) [Dwivedi and Bresson, 2020]. We also mask attention with different hops of the adjacent matrix, denoted as (Mask-n), inspired by the multi-head masking mechanisms in [Yao et al., 2020; Min et al., 2022]. We evaluate the methods on both graphlevel tasks on small graphs and node-level tasks on a single large graph. The details of the tasks and datasets are listed in Table 2. ",

We calculate the required inputs of all modules based on the subgraph instead of the original graph because most of them are not computationally scalable to large graphs. We set the maximum sampling hop to be 2 and the maximum neighbourhood per node to be 10. For PE methods, we select the embedding size from $\\{ 3 , 4 , 5 \\}$ .
