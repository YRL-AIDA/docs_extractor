These receptors are transmembrane pentameric neurotransmitter-gated ion channels that open with ligand binding, enabling fast synaptic transmission.22 The neuronal nAChR subunits are composed of -2 to $\\alpha \\mathbf { - } 1 0$ subunits and $\\beta - 2$ to $\\beta { - } 4$ a subunits.23 Although acetylcholine is the endogenous ligand for nAChRs, these receptors can also bind with nicotine.24 The -4 aand -2 nAChRs bind nicotine with bhigh affinity, whereas the -7 nAChRs abind nicotine with less affinity. Animal modeling has revealed that nicotine exposure can cause inappropriate activation or deactivation of nAChRs during critical periods of brain development.25 \nNicotine addiction causes upregulation of nAChRs.26 When nicotine binds to nAChRs, the neurotransmitter dopamine is released, reinforcing drug use27,28 and feelings of pleasure.29 Chronic exposure to nicotine can decrease responsiveness of nAChRs in the brain, alter sensitivity to dopamine, and change brain circuits involved in learning, stress, and self-control; this can result in addiction and dependence, characterized by \nwithdrawal symptoms when not using nicotine.30,31 Nicotine can also activate the endogenous opioid system through -7 nAChRs binding. a32Preclinical studies in knock-out mice have revealed that both $\\beta$ -2 and -7 subunits are important for anicotine addiction and withdrawal.23 Other neurotransmitters can also be released when nicotine binds to nAChRs, including norepinephrine, acetylcholine, serotonin, -aminobutyric acid, and glutamate.17 $\\gamma$ \n",

            "text": "The development of health issues and propensity toward addiction are likely influenced by nicotine metabolism. Nicotine is primarily metabolized by CYP2A6 in the liver, and age, genetics, sex, and kidney function can contribute to the variability in rates of nicotine metabolism.33–36 Nicotine exposure can occur during fetal and early postnatal life. Dempsey et al37 reported detectable umbilical cord nicotine levels in newborns of smoking mothers. They also found that elimination of nicotine was prolonged in the newborns compared with adults.37 Nordenstam et al11 reported that users of snuff had higher levels and slower clearance of nicotine from their breast milk compared with smokers. \nAlthough adolescent use of alternative tobacco products is increasing,38 most studies on nicotine metabolism have been done in smokers. Nevertheless, genetics likely influences the probability of nicotine addiction in both smokers and noncombustible nicotine users. A study in Mexican mestizo smokers revealed that the number of risk alleles in the CYP2A6 gene correlated with earlier initiation of smoking and greater consumption.39 Another study in adolescent smokers reported that fast metabolizers of nicotine had greater nicotine withdrawal symptoms.40 \nNicotine pharmacokinetics can also vary by nicotine-delivery device and likely contributes to addiction potential. In one study, researchers compared plasma nicotine levels in users of cigarettes, snus, and nicotine gum. They found that loose snus had peak plasma nicotine levels at 1 hour, nicotine gum at 45 minutes, and cigarette users at 7 minutes.41 A small study in adults using nicotinecontaining e-cigarettes revealed peak plasma nicotine levels at 5 minutes, with nicotine levels similar to smokers.42 Another study reported that experienced smokers and e-cigarette users can self-titrate to achieve optimal levels of nicotine.43 Additional studies are needed to further understand age-related differences in metabolism of noncombustible nicotine in infants, children, and adolescents and how these differences can affect health outcomes. \n",

Subsequently, the majority of postnatal alveolar growth occurs by age 2 years,96 with more recent evidence suggesting some additional growth into adolescence.97 Thus, any environmental exposures occurring between conception and adolescence have the potential to affect lung growth. However, parsing the effects of nicotine from those of other constituents in smoke exposure or e-cigarette aerosols in the developing human lung is difficult because the respiratory epithelium is exposed to both. \nIn utero, nicotine is readily absorbed into the maternal bloodstream and crosses the placenta, with blood levels in the fetus thought to be similar to those in the mother.98 Mechanisms by which nicotine may affect the developing lung include via nAChRs and through reduction of antioxidant enzyme activity.99,100 Animal studies of prenatal nicotine exposure reveal multiple changes within the lung, including narrowing of airways and thickening of their walls, and dysynaptic lung growth with reduced surface area complexity.98 The resultant effects in rodents include reduced forced expiratory flows in adulthood akin to obstructive lung disease in humans.101 There are some data suggesting that the pulmonary effects of prenatal nicotine may be ameliorated by antioxidant therapy \n(vitamin C) in monkeys and melatonin in rats.102,103 \nThe effects of postnatal nicotine exposure on lung development are less well elucidated than those of prenatal exposure. Nicotine and nicotine metabolites have been detected in children exposed to secondhand smoke.104 There are causal links between smoke exposure and lower respiratory tract illnesses in infants and children, asthma in school-aged children, and reduced childhood lung function, suggesting effects on immune function, airway characteristics, and lung growth.105 Several cross-sectional studies in adolescent users of e-cigarettes have revealed an association between e-cigarette use and chronic bronchitis symptoms, self-reported doctor diagnosis of asthma, higher rates of respiratory symptoms, and greater school absenteeism due to asthm a.106–109 In vitro and in vivo studies examining mucociliary clearance (MCC) in the lung have revealed that nicotine-containing e-cigarettes can impair MCC and decrease airway hydration.110,111 Impairment of MCC can alter immune defenses in the lung and increase the likelihood of lower airway infections. \nNicotine exposure in utero or in early childhood may also have respiratory effects throughout the life span of the individual through epigenetic changes, which may be heritable. One study of nicotine-exposed pregnant rats revealed that the offspring of the exposed offspring had potentially epigenetic-induced increased airway resistance and contractility proteins.112 \nAlthough no long-term studies exist, preclinical and limited clinical studies support an association between exposure to nicotine alone and impaired lung development and altered MCC. Cross-sectional studies in adolescents also suggest an increased risk for respiratory symptoms in adolescent e-cigarette \nusers with and without asthma. Prospective observational studies will be needed to fully delineate the effects of nicotine alone on lung function and respiratory outcomes. \n",
